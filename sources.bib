  abstract  = {The System Usability Scale (SUS) is widely used as a quick method for measuring usability; however, past research showed there is only a weak relationship between SUS scores and one behavioral usability measure, and alternatively, SUS corresponds more strongly with user preference. This suggests that the underlying constructs of the SUS may not be well understood. In this study, participants were asked to think aloud while completing a usability test and filling out the SUS. Correlations showed no relationship between behavioral performance and SUS scores. Instead, a relationship was observed between SUS scores and perceived success. Furthermore, participants described a variety of reasons for selecting their SUS responses that were unrelated to the usability of the system, which we have termed rationalizations. This suggests that the SUS is constructed of a combination of experiential components, including attitudinal perceptions. Consequently, SUS scores may be more helpful as a tool for comparison (between competitors, iterations, etc.,) or when used in conjunction with formative usability testing methods to provide a holistic view of real and perceived user experience.},

In the development of information and communication technology era, internet is a thing that can not be separated. The most widely used device for internet browsing is smartphone devices. Total of mobile phone users in Indonesia is growing simultaneously with mobile app users in Indonesia. Mobile application that are downloaded by many Indonesian smart phone users are transportation, references, maps or navigation, and news. Therefore, an Android based app is created that can display train and schedule information. From previous research, the level of commuterline (KRL) passengers' satisfaction is affected by the complete information that the train operation gives to its customers. The purpose of this study is for evaluating the User Interface of the KRL mobile application Access using the User Experience approach that uses performance metrics, self-reported metrics, behavioural metrics, and issue-based metrics that assess how perceived performance, perceptions, behaviour and user's impressions in interactions with the application. Based on the evaluation results, in the dimensions of Ease of Use, interface quality, and satisfaction was not good enough, so User Interface (UI) re-design using UI design principles and Activity Relationship Chart (ARC) is done. The result of this research is user experience assessment, recommendation, and interface re-design of Access KRL application that can increase user satisfaction.},

  abstract = {{A widespread belief attributes the first impression to be decisive for retaining users on websites. However, empirical investigation on this conjecture has been largely omitted. This paper examines the influence of positive and negative first impressions on subsequent website usage decisions in three different user tasks. In all tasks appealing or non-appealing website screenshots were displayed. In the first two tasks, websites were shortly presented, examining the willingness to view and the intention to stay on websites. In the third task, participants were able to browse naturally, scanning websites, deciding whether to use the website or not, and taking action eventually. Additionally, the N = 120 participants either were given or not given an explicit goal to solve in each task. Data was analysed with different statistical methods (ANOVA, McNemar and Survival Analysis). While the first impression’s significance was demonstrated in Tasks 1 and 2 for both goal mode and action mode, the usage mode was decisive for retaining users on websites in the most realistic user scenario in Task 3. Overall the effect sizes indicated that the significant differences were substantial, ranging from medium to large (Task 1: ηp2 = 0.35/0.66; Task 2: OR = 3.25/5.81; Task 3: OR = 2.11).}},

  abstract  = {Improving user experience can be achieved by developing accurate tools for tracking and measuring usability. The accuracy of these measurements will be higher when usability practitioners use tools developed in their native language. The Usability Metric for User Experience (UMUX) is a standard usability questionnaire that is developed in English. UMUX measures perceived usability and conforms to the ISO definition of usability. This work aims to translate UMUX into the Arabic language, which is the main speaking language in 22 Arabic countries with a population of more than 450 million people. This translation was based on the cross-cultural adaptation method. Forward and backward translation was performed by Arabic native speakers who are either specialized in the English language or use English as a second language. The Arabic-UMUX (A-UMUX) underwent a psychometric evaluation; the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient value was 0.879, the content scale validity index (S-CVI) value was 0.925, and the scale face value index (FVI) value was 0.95. These results conclude that A-UMUX may be deemed an adequate valid and reliable tool to be used by Arabic usability practitioners. },

  abstract = {Abstract The analysis of user interfaces using quantitative metrics is a straightforward way to quickly measure interface usability and other various design aspects (such as the suitability of page layout or selected colors). Development and evaluation of objective metrics corresponding with user perception, however, usually requires a sufficiently large training set of user interface samples. Finding real user interface samples might not be easy. Therefore, we rather use generated samples. In such case, we need to provide a realistic-looking appearance of samples. This paper describes a workflow of the preparation of such samples. It presents a configurable generator based on the composition of simple widgets according to a predefined model. It also describes a reusable library for simple creation of widgets using capabilities of the JavaScript framework Vue.js. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the generator on a generation of dashboard samples which are used to evaluate existing metrics of interface aesthetics and show the possibility of their improvement.},
