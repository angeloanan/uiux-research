  abstract  = {Mobile-based e-commerce application has begun to gain its trend. Gramedia as one of leader bookstore in Indonesia plans to create a mobile app that is accessible to its customers. The tendency of Gramedia's customer that starts accessing Gramedia.com from their gadgets is one of the main reason. Task Centered System Design (TCSD) is a method in building Human Computer Interaction that is useful to identify task-requirements and user needs. This method has been used to build the prototype. The prototype has met the requirements as the User Acceptance Test (UAT) shows that 80% acceptance whilst another 20% is accepted with notice. The method of System Usability Scale (SUS) performs a final score 80.9 showing that its usability quality is high.},

  abstract  = { ABSTRACTThe System Usability Scale (SUS) is the most widely used standardized questionnaire for the assessment of perceived usability. This review of the SUS covers its early history from inception in the 1980s through recent research and its future prospects. From relatively inauspicious beginnings, when its originator described it as a “quick and dirty usability scale,” it has proven to be quick but not “dirty.” It is likely that the SUS will continue to be a popular measurement of perceived usability for the foreseeable future. When researchers and practitioners need a measure of perceived usability, they should strongly consider using the SUS. },
