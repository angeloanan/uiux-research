\section{Introduction}

% Mary is an undergraduate student at one of the prestigious universities in the country. With her intelligence and her good marks, she has been selected for a scholarship to a university outside of the country. After registering herself as a scholarship student in the target university, she has uploaded the necessary documents to register and only need to pay some fee inorder to get fully accepted. The required payment is due in 2-3 days after the registration. But Mary hasn't received the important notice since you need to check it on the .. tabs. This lack of navigation ruined Mary's future in education.

It is a fact that we use digital technologies in our daily life. From checking your phone when waking up in the morning, until midnight before going to bed, we are constantly using technology. There can be no doubt that we are tied to it. The first thing that we see in using technologies is the user interface (UI). The interface is what the users use to add inputs and receive outputs, these may be in the form of texts, images, buttons, or videos~\cite{Gramedia}. The next thing that the users feel is user experience (UX). It is crucial because the user experience is how the users feel when they are using the interface\cite{Gramedia}, these may be how easy it is to access a certain function, how easy it is to get the information that users want, and how annoying some pop-ups or features to use. With this, the push of having both a good user interface and user experience is very pivotal, since they are the first things that users interact with. A study has shown that a good user interface alone will make users more comfortable using the software, and so does a good user experience\cite{Watulingas}. A combination of both will be the finest\cite{Watulingas}.

Creating good User Interfaces and User Experience comes with many challenges, an easily recognizable problem is when a digital application has a bad user interface, creating navigation problems. On a website, its color arrangement may cause partially sighted people to struggle to comprehend. In addition, their content hierarchy, which follows menu placement, may be difficult to locate. Another challenge with a website is to have a good user experience. Users who are familiar with a certain style of layout will have better navigation compared to those who have never seen this style or are not so tech-savvy. Issues in designing, implementing, managing, maintaining, training, evaluating and refining user interface of interactive systems are very prominent in this stage\cite{Shneiderman1987}.

To measure the level of user experience of a system, a technique called SUS is commonly used. System Usability Scale (SUS) is a widely used standardized questionnaire for assessing perceived usability\cite{JamesRLewis2018}.  SUS has accounted for 43\% of the post-study questionnaires in industrial usability studies\cite{JamesRLewis2018}. On March 13, 2018, Google Scholar citations for the paper that introduced the SUS showed 5,664 citations\cite{JamesRLewis2018}.

In this paper we are aiming to answer these research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assessing the effect of improving User Interface design and improving User Experience level in terms of the user's efficiency in navigating a sample application
    \item Examining the shift in user efficiency metrics against improvements in the sample website's design and usability
    \item Analyzing user's Usability Metric for User Experience (UMUX) for the different websites
\end{enumerate}


We chose to use UMUX, dubbed the metric to be measured when SUS takes too much time\cite{Lewis2013UMUXLITEWT}. UMUX is a relatively new standardized usability questionnaire designed to get a measurement of perceived usability consistent with the SUS\cite{Berkman2016ReassessingTU, Lewis2019MeasuringPU}, but using fewer items that more closely conformed to the ISO definition of usability (effective, efficient, satisfying). Similar to SUS, it does not matter whether the UMUX is unidimensional or tone-based bidimensional\cite{Lewis2018MeasuringPU}. In either case, practitioners should treat the UMUX as a unidimensional measure of perceived usability\cite{Lewis2018MeasuringPU}.

\section{Literature Review}

With rapid technological evolution toward intelligence and interactive technologies, it is required for us to balance everything. The 7 most outstanding challenges of humanity include Ethics, Well-being, Privacy and Security, Human-Environment Interactions and Accessibility including Universal Access\cite{Stephanidis2019SevenHG}. Human-Environment Interaction along with Accessibility is one of the points mentioned that we need to consider in our research. It has been proven that improving the UX design of real-life space may be positively influential to the accessibility of elderly people\cite{Yoo2021TheEO}, from which, we may ask whether improving a virtual program or application may reap positive benefits.

A user interface (UI) refers to a system and a user interacting with each other through commands or techniques to operate the system, input data, and use the contents\cite{Jooh}. UI is the interface that is a tool that users can use to manipulate things\cite{Roth2017UserIA} and can be found in systems such as computers, mobile devices, and games\cite{Jooh}. On the other hand, UX refers to the overall experience related to the perception (emotion and thought), reaction, and behavior that a user feels and thinks through his or her direct or indirect use of a system\cite{Jooh}. It is essentially the interaction between the user and a digital object, this is what humans experience\cite{Roth2017UserIA}.

There are a variety of challenges associated with a good user interface. One of them is aesthetics,~\cite{GlenaH} stated that for several years, Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) research has highlighted the positive impact of website aesthetics on constructs such as the overall impression, website utility, trust and credibility, perceived information quality and possibly perceived usability.~\cite{SchmidtWolff+2018+41+55} elaborated that in most cases aesthetics has a positive influence on actual performance when users must perform tasks with a user interface.

The effects of good or bad UI/UX can be seen in our daily lives. One of the important features of e-learning design is to have an attractive UI and a good UX\cite{Handayani2020GamifiedLP}. In digital shopping, UI and UX have an inverse correlation on the effect of purchase intention\cite{Watulingas}. A good UX will bring a significant positive effect on purchase intention, while the reverse is true for UI\cite{Watulingas}. In gaming, users interact with the interface for as long as the users play. Bad UI/UX can cause confusion to players which may make them leave the game\cite{Kurniawan2021UIUXMG}.

When designing UI/UX, considerations which might include the target user's age and the availability of the product (i.e, platforms, target market section, etc) must be made. Older aged users have a tougher time seeing small things and accessing different gestures like drag \& drop and tap \& hold\cite{Salman2018UsabilityEO}. Not only that, different platforms introduce different constraints. A personal computer (PC) will allow navigation using a mouse pointer and a physical keyboard, while in contrast, a mobile device will need to use a touchscreen for both mouse pointer and keyboard input. Constraints for PCs may or may not work with mobile devices and vice versa due to differences like size and resolution\cite{Garca2017ValidationON}. Developers can use tools like Data Flow Diagram to help make clear UI/UX that will increase usability and avoid confusion\cite{Wulandari2017DesignDF}.

To measure the level of user satisfaction on UX design, there are quite some indicators that are mainly used, primarily in the form of questions. The usual way of evaluating usability is to let a subset of users use the interface and analyze their satisfaction along with the ability to perform selected tasks\cite{Pastushenko}. While usability is commonly perceived as user experience, there is a subtle difference among them. `Usability' refers to the user's ability to use something to do a task, while `User Experience' takes a broader approach; looking at the individual's interaction with the object, as well as the thoughts, feelings, and perceptions generated\cite{Erlinda}.

The System Usability Scale is one old indicator that is dubbed `Quick and Dirty'\cite{Khalid}. Created in 1996, it is a widely used standardized questionnaire for the assessment of perceived usability\cite{JamesRLewis2018}. Though, SUS is very reliable to this point with score conversion and comparison to other indicators available\cite{Lewis2018MeasuringPU, Lewis2018ItemBF}. A positively worded System Usability Scale yields results that are like those generated using the standard System Usability Scale\cite{Kortum2021IsIT}; either version of the scale can be used, although the positively worded scale may yield fewer errors in responding and scoring\cite{Kortum2021IsIT}. Other approaches of evaluation are mainly a derivative of SUS\@. Research stated that compared to other models, the SUS metric achieved the highest accuracy level with the smallest number of samples\cite{Souza2019UserEE}. An improvement of the said metric has been suggested which includes text-field input for future system improvements suggestion\cite{Harper2021APS}.The higher the SUS score the better as it means that the evaluator likes it and is more likely to recommend it to other users\cite{Gramedia, Drew}.

An adaptation of SUS is the UMUX and the UMUX-LITE metric. It itself has been adapted into a possible product quality metric for healthcare technologies\cite{Borsci2019IsTL} as well as spun off into an Artificial Intelligent based conversational agent diagnostic tool\cite{Borsci2022TheCU}. While these metric were developed independently and seemingly asks of a different question, these metric has been proven again and again to measure the perceived level of usability\cite{Lewis2018MeasuringPU, Berkman2016ReassessingTU, Lewis2019MeasuringPU}.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Research Participants}

In this experiment, ten young adult participants (aged between 18 and 25) were chosen. All participants are technologically literate, having used tech devices for more than 4 hours daily. The majority of the participants are university students.

\subsection{Research Object}

Fifteen websites with various user interface design levels were chosen. These websites are divided into three categories, each category having five websites: Bad Design, Well Design, and Best Design. All chosen websites are the ones whose main functionality can be used instantaneously, without any kind of wall (i.e, authwall \& paywall).

\subsection{Research Questionnaire}

Each website has seven statements divided into three UI-related statements (scored 1 to 9) and four UMUX statements (scored 1 to 7). The following are the questions that were asked:

UI statements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The website is symmetric
    \item The website is very colorful
    \item The website is visually complex
\end{itemize}

UMUX statements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The website's capabilities meet my requirement
    \item Using this website is a frustrating experience
    \item This website is easy to use
    \item I have spent way too much time correcting things with this website
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Procedure}

After participants have given their consent on participating in the research, they are introduced to a questionnaire sheet where they will score each website  with the previously mentioned content. We then select a website from the list in a random order and wait for the participants to explore as much as they want for that website. In the end, when an entry to a website has been filled, we continue to run down the list and select another website until every website's entry has been filled.

\section{Result and Analysis}

A questionnaire filled out by 10 participants was used to calculate the results of this experiment. The results are aimed to compare between UI attributes and UMUX score.

\subsection{Calculating UMUX Score}

To calculate the UMUX score of a website, assume that \(X\) is the raw score of each questionnaire answer and \(n\) is the amount of UMUX questions in the questionnaire. The following formula was used:

\[x_{\text{odd}} = X_i - 1\]
\[x_{\text{even}} = 7 - X_i\]
\[\text{UMUX} = \frac{\Sigma^{n}_{i=0}x_i}{n}\]

The UMUX score is then summed from every respondent's answer and divided by the number of respondents to get the average UMUX score for a specific website. Lastly, these steps are repeated for every website to get the average UMUX score for each website, the higher the UMUX score the better the user experience.

\subsection{UI Attributes vs UMUX Score}

The UI attributes scores are averaged from all participants' answers according to their categories: Symmetric, Visual Complexity, and Colorful. These scores are then putted into a graph where X represents the UMUX score (ranging 0 to 100) and Y represents the UI attributes ranging (1 to 9).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \scalebox{0.39}{
        \input{./graphs/symmetric.pgf}
    }
    \caption{Plot graph of Symmetric score vs UMUX score}
    \label{fig:symmetricumux}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:symmetricumux} is a point graph visualizing the location of UMUX score compared to Symmetric score, the scale in the graph for UMUX score is zero to 100 and for Symmetric score is one to nine. Symmetry score is positively correlated with UMUX Score. The higher the UMUX score, the more likely it is to have a high symmetric score as well.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \scalebox{0.57}{
        \input{./graphs/colorful.pgf}
    }
    \caption{Plot graph of Visual Complexity score vs UMUX score}
    \label{fig:colorfulumux}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:colorfulumux} is a point graph visualizing the location of the UMUX score compared to the Colorful score. The point graph shapes convex upward, and the colorful score appears to be high at the lower and upper ends of the UMUX score, whereas the colorful score appears to be low in the middle range of the UMUX score.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \scalebox{0.57}{
        \input{./graphs/visual_complexity.pgf}
    }
    \caption{Plot graph of Visual Complexity score vs UMUX score}
    \label{fig:viscomplexumux}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:viscomplexumux} is a point graph visualizing the location of the UMUX score compared to the Visual Complexity score. The visual Complexity scores have a negative correlation with UMUX Score. The higher the UMUX score, the less likely it is to have a high visual complexity score.

\section{Conclusion}

In summary, our research has found multiple correlations between UI attributes and UMUX scores:

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a positive correlation between the Symmetric website and the UMUX score. The more symmetric the website is, the more usable it will get.
    \item There is an inverse correlation between Visually complex websites and UMUX scores. The more complex a website is, the less usable the website will be.
    \item Correlations between colorful websites versus usability (UMUX score) are not certain. At the low end of UMUX scores, the website tends to be very colorful. In the middle of my UMUX score, the website is not colorful. And at the high end of the UMUX score, the website is colorful again
    \item Further research with various website corpus is needed to get better accuracy.

% \section{Ease of Use}

% \subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

% The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins,
% column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not
% alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
% measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement
% and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper
% as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document.
% Please do not revise any of the current designations.

% \section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
% Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a
% separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before
% formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on
% proofreading, spelling and grammar.

% Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been
% formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that
% for you.

% \subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
% Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text,
% even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as
% IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use
% abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

% \subsection{Units}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
%     \item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
%     \item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
%     \item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Equations}
% Number equations consecutively. To make your
% equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or
% appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables,
% but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus
% sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a
% sentence, as in:
% \begin{equation}
%     a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
% \end{equation}

% Be sure that the
% symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following
% the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

% \subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

% Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
% of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
% to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
% citations without having to go through the file line by line.

% Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
% \verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
% environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

% Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
% will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
% equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
% article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
% the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
% counting.

%     {\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
% data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
% bibliography you must send the .bib files.

%     {\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
% subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
% referenced as Table IV-B3.

% {\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
% \verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
% supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
% cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
% should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

% Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
% will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
% any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
% surrounding equation.

% \subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
%     \item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
%     \item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
%     \item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
%     \item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
%     \item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
%     \item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
%     \item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
%     \item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
%     \item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
%     \item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
% \end{itemize}
% An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

% \subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
% \textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A
% minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names
% should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the
% next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations
% and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by
% affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for
% example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

% \subsection{Identify the Headings}
% Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through
% your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

% Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not
% topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and
% References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use
% ``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your
% table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a
% style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop
% down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

% Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For
% example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent
% material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more
% sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used
% and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads
% should be introduced.

% \subsection{Figures and Tables}
% \paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and
% bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large
% figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be
% below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert
% figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation
% ``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

% Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words
% rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to
% avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity
% ``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including
% units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only
% with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization
% \{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of
% quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not
% ``Temperature/K''.

% \section*{Acknowledgment}

% The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without
% an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B.
% G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor
% acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

% \section*{References}

% Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The
% sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference
% number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

% Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at
% the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the
% abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

% Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use
% ``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been
% submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers
% that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}.
% Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and
% element symbols.

% For papers published in translation journals, please give the English
% citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
